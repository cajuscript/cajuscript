# Import and Include

Sometimes you need to import something that already exists or organize your code.

## Import

To import Java packages, use the sign `$`:

```
$java.lang

System.out.println("Hello World!")
```

## Include

To include and execute a file and your context is merged with the current context:

```
$"fileread.cj"

fileRead("file.txt")
```
