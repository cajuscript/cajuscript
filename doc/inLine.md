# In-Line Programming

Programing in a single line.

Is supported programming in a single line with a `;` separator.

## Sample:

```
$java.lang; x = 10;
x < 10 & x > 0 ? System.out.println("X is less than 10!");
? x > 10 & x ! 10 ? System.out.println("X is greater than 10!");
? x = 10 ? System.out.println("X is 10!");
?? System.out.println("X is less than 1!");
?
x = 0; x < 10 & x >= 0 @ System.out.println(x); x += 1; @
```
